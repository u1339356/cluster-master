Release Notes OpenLava

2.2
----



FIXES
-----

-- Fix the problem of host going periodically -ok.
-- Fix timer initialization in LIM.
-- Fix mbatchd to clean HOST_STAT_EXCLUSIVE when reply lsb.events.
-- Fix job dependencies by name. The dependencies by name incorrectly
   included all jobs belong to the user submitting the jobs.
-- Fix bug in which every user can shutdown LIM.

2.2 is a bug fix release.

HIGHLIGHTS
----------
-- RPM files are no longer distributed, however they can still be built
   from the tarball.
-- When migrant hosts are added or removed, we must increment or
   decrement the numHosts field in the struct clusterNode (myClusterPtr)
   to allow the periodic master announcement to be sent to dynamic
   nodes in the cluster on master lim restart.
-- Don't call select in rd_select_() when the input file descriptor
   is less than zero, as this causes a buffer overflow abort when
   openlava is built with fortify for debian packages.
-- Fix core dump in bjobs. Since 2.1 hostid start from 0.
-- Fixed a typo in the lsf.cluster man page.
-- Print correct pending reason when hostid is 0.
-- Corrected HACKING file.
-- make install no longer installs the configuration file, this avoids
   overwriting production configuration files.
-- Added -fPIC option to configure.ac - needed when compiling the object
   code into a library for use in third party tools.
-- Fixed bsub -I, now the the job data are correcty sent to the
   user terminal and viceversa.
-- Accept `DESTDIR` environment variable, allowing staged installs.
-- Avoid announcing all LIMs at the same time.
-- Install the config.h in include directory.
-- Fixed lshosts -l core dump.
-- Change the behaviour of the SBD SIGCHLD handler. By default, the
   handler would sleep for 1 second for each child reaped, which would
   cause long waits on machines with lots of slots when lots of jobs
   finished at the same time (e.g. lots of short jobs). The default is
   now to not sleep at all.
-- Count cached memory as free memory.
-- Added error exit message for missing ncurses.h
-- Added MANPATH to shell profile scripts.
-- Allow multiple hosttypes and hostmodels in the shared and cluster file.
   LIM now can be configured with any type and model.
